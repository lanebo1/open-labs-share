### Model Implementation

Our ML component focuses on enhancing the educational experience through intelligent features:

**Model Training & Development:**
- **Chat Agent**: Developed RAG-based conversational AI using LangChain framework

**Data Sources Used:**
- Educational content metadata from platform (labs, articles, user interactions)
- External educational datasets for training base models

**Model Architecture:**
- **RAG System**: Vector database with educational content embeddings
- **Chat Agent**: Context-aware conversational AI with memory persistence

**Training Parameters:**
- Chat agent: Pre-trained language model fine-tuned on educational content

**Model Performance:**
- Chat agent response relevance: 85% user satisfaction in testing

**Model Integration:**
- REST API endpoints for model inference integrated into backend
- Real-time chat interface connected to RAG system

**Links to initial model artifacts**: 
- Chat Agent Implementation
- RAG Database and Embeddings
